# Numerical-Solutions-of-The-Schrodinger-Equation

Defined classes and class methods in Python for using the Runge Kutta 4 (RK4) and bisection methods. Solved the Schrodinger differential equation for infinite and finite wells with the former method and then found the energy eigenvalues for a particle in those wells with the latter method.
